<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>With an increase in the penetration of smart phones, delivering an on-device based self-care app has become key to customer satisfaction and retention. The features of the app have been designed by keeping the end user at the heart of the telco ecosystem. To address the issues faced by the customers, key interactions of their journey with Telco operators have been analyzed.

<h1>User journey based approach</h1>
<h3><a href="http://5dsrdm.axshare.com/#g=1&p=ivrs">Scenario 1: Service Request</a></h3>
<div class="stage">Stages of User’s Journey</div>
<img src="Images/Journey1.png" width="100%"/>
<p>Traditionally, the user engages with the IVRS system to request for a service. In some cases, the user must try multiple times or even wait for long durations to connect to the operator. To address this issue, the app simulates the IVRS experience in the form of queries and provides the user options to either Chat, request a Callback or a priority Callback (paid service) without making them wait.</p>
<h3><a href="http://5dsrdm.axshare.com/#g=1&p=usage">Scenario 2: Enquire about data plan or usage</a></h3>
<div class="stage">Stages of User’s Journey</div>
<img src="Images/Journey2.png" width="100%"/>
<p>Instead of going to the time consuming IVRS system, the user can check his data usage, outgoing minutes and SMS’ consumed by a click of a button. Not only that, the user gets detailed view of his consumption pattern which is not possible to get over a phone call.</p>
<h3><a href="http://5dsrdm.axshare.com/#g=1&p=eappointment">Scenario 3: Replace SIM Card</a></h3>
<div class="stage">Stages of User’s Journey</div>
<img src="Images/Journey3.png" width="100%"/>
<p>To replace/request for new SIM card, the user must go painstakingly wait at the store. E-appointment feature brings an innovative way of booking your time slot online which minimizes wait time at the store and hence improving customer satisfaction. The app also attempts to provide an omnichannel feel across the app and the would be Blue store.</p>
<h3><a href="http://5dsrdm.axshare.com/#g=1&p=bills">Scenario 4: Pay the Telco Bill</a></h3>
<div class="stage">Stages of User’s Journey</div>
<img src="Images/Journey4.png" width="100%"/>
<p>Some users visit either provisional stores or use AXS stations to pay their bills. The app changes the bill payment experience by using a push notification concept. The user can open the app and check their bills and make payments using preferred payment modes like debit/credit cards or PayPal.</p>
<h3><a href="http://5dsrdm.axshare.com/#g=1&p=profile">Scenario 5: Payment Process</a></h3>
<div class="stage">Stages of User’s Journey</div>
<img src="Images/Journey5.png" width="100%"/>
<p>To make the payment process even more seamless, the user can store his payment credentials such as credit/debit card details. With payment credentials already configured, the user can simply breeze through the app payment process. Further by enabling the Autopay, the app takes charge of paying your bills automatically on time.</p>

<h1>High Level Technical Specification</h1>
<p>The difference between native and hybrid app is that native app runs directly on the device and must be built to specific platforms, hence has better compatibility and performance. But if a hybrid app is exceptionally well built, it should be difficult to tell the difference between hybrid and its native version. Hybrid app retains full use of device features while making maintenance easier. Hence hybrid app would be best suited to maintain the omnichannel experience and cover the functional requirements for this application.</p>

<p>Overcoming some of the hybrid app development obstacles:</p>
